Hello and thank you for using GlitchTip. We noticed your organization {{ organization.name|striptags }}
has exceeded its monthly event limit on your {{ product.name }} and wanted to give you a heads up.
Your plan allows for {{ event_limit|intcomma }} events, but for the current billing period we have received
{{ organization.total_event_count|intcomma }} events for your organization. Here are a couple options to avoid this in the future.

Upgrade to a new plan for more events at this link:
{{ subscription_link }}

Read about configuring your SDK to send fewer events to GlitchTip here:
{{ faq_link }}

In the meantime, we have placed a {{ organization.event_throttle_rate }}% throttle on incoming events
from projects on your organization account for this billing period. If you choose to upgrade your plan,
this throttle will be removed. Otherwise, it will reset at the beginning of your next billing cycle.
